# RapidGamePrototyping
The main repository for rapid game prototyping. This repository will change a lot throughout the course of the semester. Right now I am thinking it may act as a hub, providing links to separate repositories I may make for each of the prototypes.


# MDM
One of the main goals of this study is to capture design decisions as they happen, rather then looking at it after the fact. Ideally I will be creating a process journal along with following the MDM https://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdm methodology to try and document design decisions throughout the development of seven prototypes throughout the semester.
